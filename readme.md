Important for 2-step payments with the authorisation step: 3DS, Cryptocurrency, PIX
 
Please follow carefully [2 Step payment docs](https://docs.vendoservices.com/reference/payment-gateway-3ds-flow) and pay attention to close the transaction with the 2nd, final request.

Example flow:

1. Call [Cryptocurrency payment example](https://github.com/lbadmin/vendo-sdk-php/blob/master/examples/s2s-api/crypto_payment.php)

2. Save the token


    $token = $response->getPaymentToken(); 

    // something like '2093c199fc3e20ee45af8ed07af0ddf5'


3. Redirect the user to the verification url you got in the response 

    
    $verificationUrl = $response->getResultDetails()->getVerificationUrl();

    // example: 'https://secure.vend-o.com/v/verification?transaction_id=240359080&systemsignature=moJpFrKRgo5PkP9sqStN6iJC6v8'
      
4. After authorization is completed call [Token example](https://github.com/lbadmin/vendo-sdk-php/blob/master/examples/s2s-api/payment_with_saved_token.php)
   - use token you have saved in step 2.

5. Check the Backoffice 'Sales' -> 'Transactions', you should see 2 successful transactions:
   
   - Verification
   - S2S Payment
