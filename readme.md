## API documentation
https://docs.vendoservices.com/reference/misc

Important for 2-step payments with the authorisation step: 3DS, Cryptocurrency, PIX
 
Please follow carefully [2 Step payment docs](https://docs.vendoservices.com/reference/payment-gateway-3ds-flow) and pay attention to close the transaction with the 2nd, final request.

Example flow:

1. Call [Cryptocurrency payment example](https://github.com/lbadmin/vendo-sdk-php/blob/master/examples/s2s-api/crypto_payment.php)

2. Save the verification_id


    $response->getResultDetails()->getVerificationId()

    // something like '1234567890'


3. Redirect the user to the verification url you got in the response 

    
    $verificationUrl = $response->getResultDetails()->getVerificationUrl();

    // example: 'https://secure.vend-o.com/v/verification?transaction_id=240359080&systemsignature=moJpFrKRgo5PkP9sqStN6iJC6v8'
      
4. After authorization is completed call [Crypto verification](https://github.com/lbadmin/vendo-sdk-php/blob/master/examples/s2s-api/crypto_payment_verification.php)
   - use verification_id you have saved in step 2.


    $paymentDetails->setVerificationId(1234567890);

5. Check the Backoffice 'Sales' -> 'Transactions', you should see 2 successful transactions:
   
   - Verification
   - S2S Payment
